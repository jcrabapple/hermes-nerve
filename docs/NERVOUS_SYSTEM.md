# Jev Nervous System (v0.2.1.2)

Nerve v0.2.1.2 keeps Jev off Hermes' normal critical path. Hermes remains the reasoning and execution engine; Jev is an asynchronous decision supervisor.

## Turn lifecycle

1. `pre_llm_call` creates/resolves a `turn_id` and starts Jev admission in a background worker.
2. Admission returns `OFF`, `WATCH`, or `ON` using contract `hermes/jev-turn-admission/v1`.
3. Hermes continues immediately; admission never waits in the user-turn critical path.
4. Runtime/tool events are normalized into compact JSON events and processed locally.
5. The adaptive router forwards only state changes where a remote Jev opinion could matter.
6. Jev agreement and low-confidence disagreement are logged silently.
7. High-confidence disagreement becomes a `Challenge`.
8. `transform_tool_result` attaches a still-current challenge to the next model-bound tool result. Stale challenges are discarded from delivery and retained as telemetry.
9. `post_llm_call`/`on_session_end` closes turn-scoped supervision.

## Admission

- `OFF`: ordinary conversation/creative output with no accountable decision plane expected.
- `WATCH`: a decision plane may emerge; events stay local until material work appears.
- `ON`: active asynchronous supervision for the turn.

Pure roleplay is normally OFF. Roleplay with an accountable director/training objective can be WATCH/ON at the director plane; actor dialogue itself is not a decision event.

## Local adaptive router

The router does not use "every N events" as its primary trigger. It scores semantic change from structured fields including:

- materiality and consequence
- uncertainty
- novelty
- contradiction
- strategy change
- repeated failure/recovery
- completion pressure
- risk/reversibility
- freshness of the last remote assessment

Equivalent state is suppressed by semantic hysteresis. Significant events arriving while a Jev call is already in flight are retained in a local pending batch and summarized into a later assessment.

A hard per-turn provider-call budget exists only as a safety valve.

## Decision events

For the strongest supervision, emit `nerve_event` with bounded alternatives and Hermes' proposed answer in the original event:

```json
{
  "type": "DECISION",
  "goal": "repair failing service",
  "choices": ["PATCH", "ROLLBACK", "GATHER_MORE"],
  "hermes_decision": "PATCH",
  "materiality": 0.9,
  "uncertainty": 0.6,
  "state_version": "git:abc123",
  "decision_version": "repair-4"
}
```

This avoids a second round trip asking what Hermes decided.

## Confidence-gated challenges

`nervous_challenge_confidence` controls when disagreement becomes actionable. Agreement and lower-confidence disagreement remain telemetry. `correct_next` is the recommended default: Jev can challenge the next still-actionable decision without attempting to rewind already-committed actions.

Modes:

- `shadow`: observe only; never inject a challenge.
- `correct_next`: inject current high-confidence disagreement into the next tool-result turn context.
- `precommit`: retains asynchronous operation but lets `pre_verify` consume an already-arrived completion challenge. It never synchronously waits for Jev.

## Staleness and reversibility

Events may carry `state_version` and `decision_version`. A challenge is deliverable only while the relevant decision state is current. Late opinions remain receipts, not commands. Completed irreversible actions are never automatically undone.

## Long-running workers

Supervision is scoped to the turn, not a wall-clock timeout. A two-hour turn with hundreds of tool calls can remain ON. Raw events are accumulated locally; remote calls are driven by semantic relevance and batching rather than volume.

## Local learning

`OutcomeStore` can record labeled decision outcomes. After `nervous_local_learning_min_samples`, a tiny local historical model can calibrate router sensitivity from observed usefulness. It does not add another remote LLM.

## Privacy

The nervous system should receive compact structured state rather than full transcripts. Tool-result previews are bounded by `nervous_event_preview_chars`, and existing recursive secret-redaction remains available at provider boundaries. Raw roleplay/chat transcripts are not required for event supervision.

## 0.2.1 repeated-failure control lease

0.2.1 adds an execution-side recovery seam for a failure mode observed in Muna:
Jev could repeatedly recommend `REPLAN` or `GATHER_EVIDENCE` while Hermes still
issued the exact same failing action.

Each failed tool action now receives two stable local identities:

- **action fingerprint**: tool name + canonicalized arguments
- **failure fingerprint**: action fingerprint + status/available exit code + normalized error signature

The first failure can be assessed remotely. Exact repeats are deduplicated locally
until materially new state/evidence appears. At the configured repeat threshold
(default `3`), a provider-independent local `REPLAN` control is created.

Under `correct_next` and `precommit`:

- `REPLAN`, `GATHER_EVIDENCE`, and `ESCALATE` block the exact controlled action;
- a materially different next action counts as following the control and consumes it;
- `RETRY` explicitly allows one next action and consumes the control;
- `shadow` records the same lifecycle but does not constrain execution.

The plugin uses one composed `pre_tool_call` callback: local control is checked
first, and the optional legacy synchronous gate is only consulted if local control
allows the action. This prevents a known-bad repeated action from also paying an
unnecessary gate provider round trip.

Control receipts use stable `decision_id` values and lifecycle stages so telemetry
can connect decision -> delivery -> next action -> followed/enforced/expired -> outcome.
